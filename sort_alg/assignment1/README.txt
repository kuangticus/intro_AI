In this zip there is the main files that we need to get the program running.

We have already included the a.out in the .zip

To run the program simply do: a.out <initial state file> <goal state file> <algorithm> <output file>

Options for <algorithms> are:

bfs
dfs
iddfs
astar

(spelled exactly the same)

If you need to compile the the program use command:

g++ -std=c++11 assig1.cpp algorithms.cpp
