# sentiment
Run program with python3 sentiment.py

Needs testSet.txt and trainingSet.txt to be in the same directory to run

You can delete preprocessed_test.txt, preprocessed_train.txt, results.txt before running as the program just overwrites these file each time. Keeping them and not keeping them will not affect our program 

This program takes bit to run, enjoy a cup of coffee while you're at it. Thank you!
